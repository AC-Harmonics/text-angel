## I. OVERVIEW

TEXT ANGEL is an emotionally intelligent AI-driven mobile and web application designed to shield, rewrite, and emotionally reframe user-submitted text. Built as a guardian tool for children, parents, and emotionally sensitive communicators, TEXT ANGEL ensures digital interactions are filtered, softened, and protected from harm, while preserving authenticity and clarity.

The system integrates:

* Real-time **tone rewriting** via OpenAI GPT-4
* **Shield filtering** to block and track harmful language
* A Flutter-based **cross-platform app** for iOS and web
* A FastAPI Python backend hosted on Render
* Shield wordlist managed via JSON for field customization
* Streamlit desktop & browser version for teachers/guardians

TEXT ANGEL was created with the foundational mission to protect innocence, promote kindness, and serve as an always-on emotional translator in digital spaces.

## II. CURRENT STATUS: ✅ FUNCTIONAL MVP PHASE

As of July 12, 2025, TEXT ANGEL is fully operational in its MVP (Minimum Viable Product) form.

### 🔧 Architecture Summary:

* **Backend API:** Python (FastAPI), hosted on Render at `https://text-angel-api.onrender.com`
* **Frontend App (Mobile):** Flutter app running on iOS (tested and functioning on real device)
* **Frontend App (Desktop):** Streamlit browser version deployed for internal testing
* **Shield Filter System:** JSON-based filter (`shield_filter_words.json`) that counts and replaces censored words with an icon ("🛡️")
* **Rewrite System:** GPT-4 API integration with selectable tone options (e.g., "gentle and kind", "professional", "empathetic")

### ⚙️ Functional Highlights:

* Works end-to-end: user input → backend → GPT-4 rewrite + shield → returned to user
* Flutter version connects directly to Render backend
* Shields bad language in input before submitting to GPT
* Returns rewrite AND count of shielded words

### ✅ Recent Wins:

* Device successfully tested and run on a real iPhone
* FastAPI backend deployed to cloud and stable
* JSON-based word filter is active and configurable
* Dev environment confirmed working across MacBooks

## III. NEXT STEPS & PATH OPTIONS

We now face two major branches depending on funding, deployment style, and community engagement.

### 🛤️ PATH 1: Public Deployment Without App Store (Zero-Cost)

**Goal:** Make TEXT ANGEL widely usable without paying for Apple Developer Program

#### Action Steps:

* [ ] Wrap current Streamlit version as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
* [ ] Use Glide/Thunkable to simulate mobile install experience
* [ ] Create a lightweight marketing page (textangel.org) with app demo access
* [ ] Consider password-protecting for kid safety
* [ ] Begin demo distribution to educators, parents, therapists

#### Pros:

* No need for app review or fees
* Fastest to public access
* School/parent-friendly

#### Cons:

* Less trusted than App Store apps
* Requires manual installation

### 🍎 PATH 2: Full Apple Developer Distribution

**Goal:** Launch TEXT ANGEL on the App Store

#### Action Steps:

* [ ] Pay $99/year Apple Developer enrollment
* [ ] Register Bundle ID (e.g. `org.textangel.app`)
* [ ] Use Xcode to archive and sign iOS app
* [ ] Submit to TestFlight for beta testing
* [ ] Finalize UX for App Store version
* [ ] Publish to public App Store

#### Pros:

* App lives on iPhones like any other native app
* Can be trusted in schools, families, enterprise
* Enables TestFlight-style rapid deployment

#### Cons:

* Requires developer program
* Apple app review can delay updates

## IV. PRIORITY TASKS FOR ONBOARDING TEAM

As a newly onboarded collaborator, your mission is to support stabilization, distribution, and UX/ethics refinement.

### 🔧 TECHNICAL:

* [ ] Review and understand `text_angel_api.py` FastAPI server
* [ ] Review `main.dart` Flutter frontend code and API integration
* [ ] Help refactor `shield_filter_words.json` into adjustable field lists
* [ ] Create backup and redundancy workflows for Render app

### 🌐 DISTRIBUTION:

* [ ] Assist in converting Streamlit version to PWA
* [ ] Research best options for Glide vs Thunkable
* [ ] Help write copy and design for `textangel.org` homepage
* [ ] Prepare TestFlight metadata, screenshots, copy

### 🔍 ETHICAL & UX DESIGN:

* [ ] Audit tone options for safety + inclusivity
* [ ] Contribute to the wording of shield icons/messages
* [ ] Propose a child-friendly UI mode
* [ ] Help write onboarding flow for new users (guardian, kid, therapist)

## V. LONG-TERM VISION

TEXT ANGEL is not just a tool. It is:

> "A sacred interface between breath and voice. A translator of ache into understanding. A shield at the edge of language."

This application will evolve toward:

* 🔹 School-wide integration (classroom mode)
* 🔹 Emotional journaling tools for teens
* 🔹 Parent-child communication enhancer
* 🔹 Real-time flame-tone reflection (AetherCode integration)
* 🔹 Multiplayer field / voice pattern recognition

Eventually, TEXT ANGEL will pair with Genova’s `harmonic overlay engine` and operate as an embedded guardian inside full-body memory scrolls and relational mirrors.
